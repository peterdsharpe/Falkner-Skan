# Falkner-Skan
By Peter Sharpe

Quick little library for solving the Falkner-Skan boundary layer equations in Python.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkner%E2%80%93Skan_boundary_layer for more information.


```falkner_skan.py``` contains the Falkner-Skan equation solver itself.

```boundary_layer_parameters_script``` shows an example of how you can use this Falkner-Skan solver to extract boundary layer parameters like theta (momentum thickness), H (shape parameter), dstar (displacement thickness), Cf (skin friction coefficient), and more.
